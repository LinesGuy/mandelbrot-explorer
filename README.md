# mandelbrot-explorer
pygame mandelbrot explorer

Controls:
E zooms in, Q zooms out (based on mouse position)
W increases iter_num, S decreases it
D increases fractal render resolution, A decreases it

This is really just for fun and is significantly slower than any half-decent implementation of a mandelbrot explorer.
