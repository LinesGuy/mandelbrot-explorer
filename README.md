# mandelbrot-explorer
pygame mandelbrot explorer

Controls:

Left click zooms in on mouse position, Right click zooms out
Q decreases power, E increases power
W increases iter_num, S decreases it
D increases fractal render resolution, A decreases it

This is really just for fun and is significantly slower than any half-decent implementation of a mandelbrot explorer.
